Atlassian Confluence Stylus RTL style for persian, arabic and other RTL languages.

- First install: https://github.com/openstyles/stylus
- Copy style.css into domain settings.
- It's done, you can easily create document and view them in Confluence. 

*note:* All your team members should use Stylus or else they will see documents in LTR and it's messy.
